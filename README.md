## Objective

The primary goal of this notebook is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ACEA Smart Water Analytics dataset. By visualizing various aspects of the data, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that can inform better water resource management strategies.

##  Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the **ACEA Smart Water Analytics** dataset, which encompasses a wide range of features related to water resources. This dataset is part of a Kaggle competition focused on predicting water availability and optimizing its management.

## Approach

The notebook is structured as follows:

### 1. Data Exploration
- **Understanding the Data Structure:** Examined the dataset's dimensions, feature types, and sample entries.
- **Statistical Summaries:** Calculated descriptive statistics to grasp the central tendencies and dispersions of the data.

### 2. Data Visualization
- **Time Series Analysis:** Plotted time series graphs to observe trends and seasonal patterns in water levels and usage.
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Visualized correlations between different variables to identify potential relationships.
- **Geospatial Plots:** Mapped data points to understand the geographical distribution of water resources.
- **Distribution Plots:** Analyzed the distribution of key variables to detect skewness, outliers, and anomalies.

## Insights

Through this analysis, several key insights were uncovered:

- **Seasonal Variations:** Identified significant seasonal trends in water usage and availability.
- **Correlated Features:** Discovered strong correlations between certain meteorological factors and water levels.
- **Geographical Patterns:** Observed regional differences in water resource metrics, highlighting areas that may require focused management.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Geopandas, Folium
